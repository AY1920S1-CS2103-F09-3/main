== Overview

CS ModBuddy is a desktop application used for NUS CS undergraduates to plan modules and manage their study plans.
It supports basic operations such as adding modules to and removing modules from different semester.
In addition, the user may create multiple study plans, toggle between different versions of the same study plan,
classify their modules via tagging, and check the various constraints on module prerequisites and MC-counts, while
assisted by many user-friendly features such as undo/redo, autocomplete and an elegant GUI.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 30 kLoC.
CS ModBuddy is morphed from AddressBook-Level 3.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major feature*: added *version tracking for individual study plans*
** What it does: allows the user to save the state of the current active study plan.
Each study plan has its own commit history, which represents a chronological series of states of this study plan.
The user can make a commit, i.e. save the current state, and revert to this commit in the future if they so choose.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may be unsure of the changes they
are currently making, and thus may want to revert to a previous state in the future.
** Highlights: This feature stores a snapshot of the a study plan. Every time the user makes a commit, the study
plan is cloned and stored in a list of commits corresponding to each study plan. Corresponding JSON storage support
was also implemented so that the commits can be stored to local files immediately.

* *Minor enhancements*:
- Enabled the user to add, delete, switch between multiple study plans.
- Enabled the user to add and delete _non-mainstream_ semesters (i.e. special terms or Year 5 semesters).
- Implemented most of the storage classes so that study plans and their associated information can be stored to
local files in JSON format.
