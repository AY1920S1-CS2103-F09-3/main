== Overview

CS ModBuddy is a desktop application that can be used for module planning by NUS undergraduates taking a Computer
Science major. The user interacts with it using a CLI and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and
has about 85kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to manage and classify modules and study plans with tag-related commands*
** What it does:
*** For pass:q[<u>modules</u>]: Users can _add_, _delete_, _rename_ and _view_ tags, as well as view modules
that are filtered according to their tags
*** For pass:q[<u>study plans</u>]: Users can add _priority_ tags to study plans to indicate the relative importance
of different study plans and view a list of study plans that are sorted according to their priorities
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because module planning is considerably complex given
the variety of modules that one can choose from. Hence, the application should provide a convenient way to manage and
categorize them for easier viewing and neater planning.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. Instead of adopting the previous
implementation of creating a new tag object every time a change is made, this implementation modifies the existing tag
directly. In addition, references were used to allow various entities to store the same tag. This not only promotes
consistency when a change to a tag is made, but also the efficiency of a command as only one object has to be modified.
Polymorphism was also utilized to support the storage of different types of tags (e.g. default tags, user-created tags
and priority tags)

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a command that allows users to find the semester in which a module is current located
within the active study plan.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** In charge of managing documentations and deadlines and deliverables
*** Managed some milestones (assigned issues to other members and closed milestone)
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Did basic refactoring of AddressBook, Person and other related classes (e.g. Name, Address, etc.) in AB3 to Module Planner and Study Plan classes (Pull request https://https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F09-3/main/pull/111.com[#111])
*** Added result view panel in GUI to show different result types (e.g. tag cards, module cards) depending on executed command (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F09-3/main/pull/184[#184])
*** Modified Tag class to an interface that supports different types of tags and changed existing tests (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F09-3/main/pull/104[#104], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F09-3/main/pull/221[#221], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-F09-3/main/pull/145[#145])
** Documentation:
*** Contributed to modification of overall design part of the developer’s guide
** Community:
*** Helped to fix minor bugs in teammates’ codes
