== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `addmod y1s1 cs1231s`.

.Component interactions for the `addmod y1s1 cs1231s` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.
`SemesterListPanel`, `ResultDisplay`, `CommandBox`, `StudyPlanTagPanel`, etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data. 

// tag::logic[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `modulePlannerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

//end::logic[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the module planner data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `module planner`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `module planner` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +

//end::
[]

// tag::storage[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `ModulePlanner` data in json format and read it back.
* can save the `ModulesInfo` data in json format and read it back.

// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]

=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is inpired by the undo/redo implementation in AddressBook 3 and is facilitated by `VersionedModulePlanner`.
It extends `modulePlanner` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `historyStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedModulePlanner#commit()` -- Saves the current module planner state in its history.
* `VersionedModulePlanner#undo()` -- Restores the previous module planner state from its history.
* `VersionedModulePlanner#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone module planner state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#saveToHistory()`, `Model#undo()` and `Model#redo()` respectively.

[NOTE]
Currently, the undo-redo mechanism does not include/respond to changes to commands involving Commits - saving and removing changes to the storage files.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedModulePlanner` will be initialized with the initial module planner state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single module planner state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `addmod CS3233 y1s1` command to add the Module `CS3233` module into Semester `y1s1` in the active study plan. The `addmod` command calls `Model#saveToHistory()`, causing the modified state of the module planner after the `addmod CS3233 y1s1` command executes to be saved in the `historyStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted module planner state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `removemod CS1101s y1s1` to remove the Module `CS1101S` module from Semester `y1s1` in the active study plan. The `remove` command also calls `Model#saveToHistory()`, causing another modified module planner state to be saved into the `historyStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#saveToHistory()`, so the module planner state will not be saved into the `historyStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that removing the module was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous module planner state, and restores the module planner to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial module planner state, then there are no previous module planner states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the module planner to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `historyStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest module planner state, then there are no undone module planner states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `history`. Commands that do not modify the module planner, such as `history`, will usually not call `Model#saveToHistory()`, `Model#undo()` or `Model#redo()`. Thus, the `historyStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves a copy of the  entire module planner in the `historyStateList`. It does this by performing a clone operation through the hierachy of classes of the ModulePlanner, from StudyPlan, Semester, Module down to Tag.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. Need to take note of the implications of cloning all the objects.
* **Alternative 2:** Implement redo/undo for every single command.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `removemod`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: Tedious because there are a lot of commands and we must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::versiontracking[]
=== Version Tracking
==== Current Implementation

The version tracking mechanism (or _commit_ mechanism) is facilitated by `VersionTrackingManager`.
It is stored as an instance attribute of a `ModulePlanner` object.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionTrackingManager#getStudyPlanCommitManagerByStudyPlan(StudyPlan studyPlan)` -- Returns the `StudyPlanCommitManager` for the specified study plan.
* `VersionTrackingManager#commitStudyPlan(StudyPlan studyPlan, String commitMessage)` -- Saves the current state of the
study plan in its history stored in its corresponding `StudyPlanCommitManager`, together with a commit message.
* `VersionTrackingManager#deleteStudyPlanCommitManagerByIndex(int index)` -- Deletes a `StudyPlanCommitManager`
specified by the index of its corresponding study plan.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitActiveStudyPlan(String commitMessage)`,
 `Model#deleteStudyPlanCommitManagerByIndex(int index)` etc.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the commit mechanism behaves at each step.


Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionTrackingManager` will be initialized with the
initial module planner state, and its `StudyPlanCommitManagerList` will only contain a manager for the default study plan.

image::VersionTrackingClassDiagram.png[]

Step 2. After changing the state of the current active study plan (e.g. by calling `addmodule y1s1 cs1101s`),
the user executes `commit first draft` command to save the current state of this study plan with the commit message
`first draft`. The `commit` command calls `Model#commitActiveStudyPlan(String commitMessage)`,
causing the modified state of the current active study plan after the `commit first draft command executes to be cloned and saved
in the `StudyPlanCommitManager` corresponding to this study plan, inside the `VersionTrackingManager` under
`ModulePlanner`.

image::CommitStudyPlan.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `revert 1.1` to revert to the commit indexed by `1` in the active study plan which
has an index of `1`. The `revert` command also calls `Model#revertCommit(int studyPlanIndex, int commitNumber)`,
causing the state of the study plan stored in this commit to be made active, and this reverted state to be saved
into the `StudyPlanCommitManager` inside the `VersionTrackingManager` as a revert commit.

image::RevertCommitSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
If a study plan does not have any commit history, it will not call `Model#revertCommit(int studyPlanIndex, int commitNumber)`,
so the no commit will be made active. Instead it will prompt the user to create commits first.

Step 4. The user now decides that there is a commit that they want to delete from the history completely,
and decides to delete that commit by executing the `deletecommit` command. The `deletecommit` command
will call `Model#deleteCommit(int studyPlanIndex, int commitNumber)`,
which will delete the commit specified by the `commitNumber` from the history of the study plan with index `studyPlanIndex`.

// image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the commit number entered does not refer to a valid commit (e.g. there is no commit at all or the index is out of bounds),
no deletion will take place. Instead the user will be prompted by an error message.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `deletecommit` operation works:

image::DeleteCommitActivityDiagram.png[]

// Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `history`.
// image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

//Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`.
// image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a commit command:

// image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How commit executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire state of the study plan at the moment of commit.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Only saves the difference of the current state from the state of the last commit.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `addmodule`, just store the module being added).
** Cons: We must ensure that the differences in states are stored and loaded correctly when we switch between commits.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the commit commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of commits for each study plan.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Each study plan has a clear history of its own.
** Cons: Hard to handle the possibility of branching (which is currently disallowed).
// end::versiontracking[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

//tag::moduletagging[]
=== Module Tagging Feature

==== Implementation
The module tagging mechanism is facilitated by `UserTag`, `DefaultTag` and `UniqueTagList`.

`UserTag` and `DefaultTag` implement the `Tag` interface. The former represents user-created tags while the latter
represents default tags of one of the types in `DefaultTagType`. The key difference between `UserTag` and `DefaultTag`
is that the first is user-modifiable while the second is not and is essentially immutable. The operation
`Tag#isDefault()` is implemented to differentiate between the two classes of `Tag`.

Each `Tag` is stored in a `UniqueTagList`, which implements `Iterable<Tag>` and is stored internally in `Module` and
`StudyPlan` as `tags`.  It represents a list of tags that can be of type `UserTag` or `DefaultTag` and enforces the
uniqueness between the tags. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `UniqueTagList#addTag(Tag toAdd)` -- Adds the given `Tag` to the list.
- `UniqueTagList#removeTag(Tag toRemove)` -- Removes the given `Tag` from the list.
- `UniqueTagList#containsTagWithName(String tagName)` -- Checks if the list contains a `Tag` with the given `tagName`.
- `UniqueTagList#getTag(String tagName)` -- Returns the `Tag` with the given `tagName`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the `UniqueTagList#addTag(Tag toAdd)` operation and how the module tagging
mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `addtag MODULE_CODE TAG_NAME`. command to add a tag with the name _TAG_NAME_ to the
module with the module code _MODULE_CODE_.  A `toAdd` variable of type `Tag` and a boolean value `newTagCreated` is
maintained during the execution of the command to represent the tag that is to be added and whether or not a new tag
has been created respectively. The `addtag` command calls `Model#activeSpContainsTag(String tagName)` to check if the
active study plan contains a tag with the given `tagName`. This method accesses the active study plan in the module
planner and checks if such a tag exists in its `UniqueTagList`. There are two possible scenarios that are described
in steps 2 and 3.

Step 2. If such a tag does not exist, a new `UserTag` is created and is assigned to `toAdd`.

image::TagModuleCommandDiagram1.png[]

Step 3. If such a tag exists, `Model#getTagFromActiveSp(String tagName)` is called. The `Tag` in the `UniqueTagList`
of the active study plan is returned and assigned to `toAdd`. `Tag#isDefault()` is called to check if the returned `Tag`
is a `DefaultTag`. If so, a `CommandException` is thrown as default tags cannot be added by users.

image::TagModuleCommandDiagram2.png[]

[NOTE]
We only have to handle the case of adding default tags in this step and not in the previous step as default tags are
already initialised into the study plan and hence `Model#activeSpContainsTag(String tagName)` will always return true
if the given name is a default tag name.

Step 4. `Model#addTagToActiveSp(UserTag toAdd, String moduleCode)` is called to add `toAdd` to the module with the
given module code. This method accesses the module with the given `moduleCode`, which will call `Module#addTag(Tag tag)`
to add `toAdd` to its `UniqueTagList`. In the case that `toAdd` already exists in the `UniqueTagList`, it will not be
added, and the method will return `false`. (Step 5)

[NOTE]
The above scenario should not occur if a new tag had been created as described in Step 2.

Otherwise, the `toAdd` will be added and the method will return `true`. (Step 6)

image::TagModuleCommandDiagram3.png[]

image::TagModuleCommandDiagram4.png[]

Step 5. If the tag had not been added, it would indicate that an essentially identical tag had already been attached to
the target module. Hence, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

[NOTE]
`Tag` has a method `Tag#isSameTag` to identify essentially identical tags by comparing the tag names for `UserTag`
(this is case-insensitive) and the `DefaultTagType` for `DefaultTag`.

Step 6: If the tag had been added, a `CommandResult` with a success message is returned.

The following sequence diagram and activity diagram show how the `addtag` command works:

image::TagModuleCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

image::TagModuleCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How tags are assigned to modules

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** A tag with a given name is only created once. Adding a tag to a module simply
creates a reference from the module to the existing tag.
** Pros: Reduces memory usage and makes duplication checking easier (simply check the `UniqueTagList` of the `StudyPlan`
instead of checking the list in every `Module`).
** Cons: More difficult to implement and requires searching and reassignment of pointers every time the command is
executed.
* **Alternative 2:** A new tag is created every time a tag is added even if there is already an existing tag with the
same name.
** Pros: Easier to implement as no searching of previous tags need to be done.
** Cons: Increases memory usage and duplication checking might be more difficult (have to check the `UniqueTagList` of
every `Module` instead of just the one in the `StudyPlan`.

//end::moduletagging[]

//tag::moduleinformationandverification[]

=== Module Information and Verification

==== Implementation

The reading of modules information is facilitated by `ModulesInfo`, which contains a list of `ModuleInfo` objects.

All information regarding our modules are initially stored in json format, within the file
`src/main/resources/modules_cs.json`.
Information in a `ModuleInfo` object includes:

- `code`: Module code
- `name`: Module name
- `mc`: MC count
- `su`: Whether the module can be S/U-ed
- `isCore`: Whether the module is a core module
- `focusPrimaries`: List of focus area primaries
- `focusElectives`: List of focus area electives
- `description`: Module description
- `prereqTree`: Module's prerequisite tree

Upon starting the main app, the data is read once into a `ModulesInfo` object, which contains a list
of `ModuleInfo` objects -- it is then passed into our model, whereby our `ModelManager` holds it as a reference.

Upon creating a study plan, the module planner will create the relevant `Module` objects, whose information
matches their corresponding `ModulesInfo` objects. Each `Module` object should correspond to exactly one
`ModuleInfo` object (with the same module code).

==== Prerequisite checking

To facilitate prerequisite checking, we have an interface `PrereqTree`, implemented by two classes
`PrereqLeaf` and `PrereqNode`.

image::VerificationPrereqTreeClassDiagram.png[]

Each `PrereqLeaf` represents a module prerequisite. Each `PrereqNode` has an AND or OR operator -- for instance,
(CS2030 AND CS2040) would be represented by a `PrereqNode` with the operator AND, with two `PrereqLeaf` leaves:
one for CS2030, and one for CS2040.

Importantly, `PrereqTree` contains the method `verify(List<String> prevSemCodes)`. Given a list of strings of module
codes taken in previous semesters, the prerequisite tree will return a boolean value, signalling if the module already
has its prerequisites satisfied.

Upon executing any command, the method `refresh()` will be called in the module manager, which verifies the prerequisites
of every `Module` and updates them in the GUI. Modules that do not have their prerequisites fulfilled will be shown
with a red tag beside it.

image::VerificationRefreshSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram shows how the verification works for each module:

image::VerificationActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Relationship between a module and its module information

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: All `ModuleInfo` objects are only created once
upon initialising the application, one for each CS module.
When creating a `Module` object, it then finds the corresponding `ModuleInfo` object (with the same module code),
then derives its attributes (e.g. name, MC count, tags) from it.

** Pros: The json file is only read once to create all `ModuleInfo` objects at once, which is more efficient.
** Cons: It could lead to greater code complexity,
as the model manager needs to keep track of not only `Module` objects, but also `ModuleInfo` objects.

* **Alternative 2**: Whenever a new `Module` object is created, it re-reads the json file to read in
the necessary information.
** Pros: The module manager does not need to persistently hold on to the same list of `ModuleInfo` objects.
** Cons: It performs the same reading action multiple times, which could lead to slowdowns.

//end::moduleinformationandverification[]

=== Autocomplete

==== Implementation

image::AutocompleteClassDiagram.png[width="600"]

The autocompletion of keywords is facilitated by `AutocompleteTextField`, which inherits from `Textfield`,
and `ModulePlannerAutocompleteSearch`.
`AutocompleteTextField` handles user input and changing the text in the text field.
`ModulePlannerAutocompleteSearch` handles the autocorrect searching for keywords.

When the `MainWindow` is created, a `CommandBox` is created and added to the GUI.
The `CommandBox` creates an `AutocompleteTextField` and it is added to the GUI.
The `AutocompleteTextField` holds a `ModulePlannerAutocompleteSearch`.

`CommandBox` attaches a `keyEvent` listener to `AutocompleteTextField` that listens for the `TAB` key press,
which starts the autocomplete process.

`ModulePlannerAutocompleteSearch` holds two sets of keywords, a set for commands and a set for arguments.
These keywords are represented as `SortedSet<String>`.
Within each input, the first word will be autocompleted with the set for commands,
while subsequent words (separated by spaces) will be autocompleted with the set for arguments.
An exception is the `help` command, in which the subsequent words will be autocompleted with the
set for commands.

`ModulePlannerAutocompleteSearch` is constructed with a `ReadOnlyModulePlanner`.
It is used to create the keyword sets.
Hence, `AutocompleteTextField` is also constructed with a `ReadOnlyModulePlanner` to pass this down.

The following sequence diagram shows the creation of Autocomplete:

image::AutocompleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

`AutocompleteTextField` holds the following public operations:

- `AutocompleteTextField#handleAutocomplete` -- Handles the entire autocomplete process based on the current text.

- `AutocompleteTextField#handleChangeOfActiveStudyPlan` -- Resets the argument keywords when there is a
change in the active study plan.

`ModulePlannerAutocompleteSearch` is never accessed by any external classes.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the `AutocompleteTextField#handleAutocomplete()` operation
and how the autocomplete mechanism behaves at each step for commands.

Step 1. The user enters the beginning of a command into the GUI text field, for example "addt" for `addtag`.
The user then presses the activation key `TAB` with begins the autocomplete process.
The `KeyEvent` listener calls the `AutocompleteTextField#handleAutocomplete()` operation.

Step 2: `AutocompleteTextField` passes the input to `ModulePlannerAutocompleteSearch`, by calling
`ModulePlannerAutocompleteSearch#getSearchResults(String input)`.
In `ModulePlannerAutocompleteSearch`, the text in the text field is checked.
As it is the first word, the keywords set for commands is used.
`ModulePlannerAutocompleteSearch#performSearch(String input, SortedSet<String> keywords)`
is called to proceed with the search.

Step 3: This method finds search results, which is a subset from the keywords set for commands that begin with the input.
This result is returned back through `ModulePlannerAutocompleteSearch#getSearchResults(String input)`.
`AutocompleteTextField#handleAutocomplete()` uses the search results to proceed.
There are two possible scenarios that are described in Steps 4 and 5.

Step 4: If there is only one search result,
`AutocompleteTextField#setAutocompleteText(String searchResult)` is called. Proceed to Step 6.

Step 5: If there is more than one search result, a menu will be created for the user to make a selection.
This method will call the `populateMenu(List<String> searchResult)` method, and then show the menu if it is not showing.
Then, focus will be requested from the first menu item in the menu. The `populateMenu(List<String> searchResult)`
populates a `ContextMenu` with `CustomMenuItem`, which correspond to each search result.
On action of the menu item, either through clicking or pressing the key `ENTER` while it is focused,
`AutocompleteTextField#setAutocompleteText(String searchResult)` is called. Proceed to Step 6.

Step 6: `AutocompleteTextField#setAutocompleteText(String searchResult)`
causes the input text to be changed to the search result and the caret
positioned at the end of the line.

The autocomplete mechanism behaves similarly for arguments, except the argument set of keywords will be used.
Furthermore, `AutocompleteTextField#setAutocompleteText(String searchResult)` will cause
the input text to be changed to the text before the space concatenated with a space and the search result
and the caret is positioned at the end of the line.
This change replicates autocompleting only the last word without erasing previous terms.

The following activity diagram shows how the autocomplete works:

image::AutocompleteActivityDiagram.png[width="600"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How autocompletion is broken down
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: One class for handling the text field, one class for handling the querying.

** Pros: Easier for testing. More cohesion.
** Cons: More classes written.

* **Alternative 2 **: One class to handle everything.

** Pros: Easier to code.
** Cons: Harder to test.

===== Aspect: How arguments are completed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: All arguments including semester names, tags and module codes are checked for
together.

** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: User may want to only be autocompleting for tags, but module codes appear as well.

* **Alternative 2**: Arguments are identified as tags or module codes and autocompleted based on
the command.
** Pros: User can autocomplete without undesired suggestions.
** Cons: The command will have to be parsed upon autocomplete call, which will
take more time and alter the structure of parsing commands.

===== Aspect: How help is implemented
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Help is treated as a special case.

** Pros: Easy to implement. Help is the only command that takes in commands as arguments.
** Cons: A hard-coded exception does not make the code extensible.

* **Alternative 2**: Every command is parsed and their keywords identified.
** Pros: More extensible as help is future commands can take in commands as keywords.
** Cons: The command will have to be parsed upon autocomplete call, which will
take more time and alter the structure of parsing commands.

** All modules are not taken together with any of their respective preclusions.
** The user, by following this study plan, satisfies their graduation requirements and will be able to graduate without
extending their candidature in NUS.

[[focus-area]] Focus area::
CS modules are organised into Focus Areas of coherent modules according to technical areas of study.
A CS Focus Area is satisfied by completing 3 modules from the Area Primaries, with at least one module at 4000-level or
above. CS Foundation Modules (CFM) that appear in the Area Primaries can be counted as one of the 3 modules towards
satisfying a Focus Area. In this case, a student has to read just two other modules in the Area Primaries to satisfy
the Focus Area. The ten Focus Areas are listed below:
** Algorithms & Theory
** Artificial Intelligence
** Computer Graphics and Games
** Computer Security
** Database Systems
** Multimedia Information Retrieval
** Networking and Distributed Systems
** Parallel Computing
** Programming Languages
** Software Engineering

[[graduation]] Graduation::

and finish their studies with a Bachelor's degree.

[[GUI]] GUI::
Abbreviation for the Graphical User Interface, which allows users to interact with electronic devices through
graphical icons and visual indicators as opposed to a Command Line Interface (CLI).

[[leave-of-absence]] Leave of Absence::
Also known as LOA for short. During LOA, students will temporarily stop taking NUS modules for an extended period
of time, usually one semester. Students may be granted leave of absence for the following reasons:
** Medical reasons
** Academic reasons
** Personal reasons

[[mainstream-os]] Mainstream OS::
Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X.

[[major]] Major::
An academic major is the academic discipline to which an undergraduate student formally commits. A student who
successfully completes all modules required for the major qualifies for an undergraduate degree.

[[minor]] Minor::
A Minor programme is a coherent course of study providing significant depth in a certain area outside that of the Major,
within or outside the student's department.The modular credit (MC) requirement for a Minor programme should be at least
24MCs, of which up to 8MCs may be used to meet the requirements for both the Minor and a Major or another Minor subject
to the agreement of the particular department(s), faculty/faculties or programme(s) hosting the Minor.

[[modular-credits]] Modular credits::
The undergraduate and graduate curricula are based on a modular system. Under this system, workloads are expressed
in terms of Modular Credits (MCs), and academic performance is measured by grade points on a 5-point scale.

[[module]] Module::
A module (colloquially _mod_) is a class of a specific topic that generally runs for an entire semester. Each module carries a stipulated
number of Modular Credits and requires weekly contact hours for students.

[[module-code]] Module code::
Each module of study has a unique module code consisting of a two- or three-letter prefix that denotes the discipline,
and four digits, the first of which indicates the level of the module (e.g., 1000 indicates a Level 1 module and 2000,
a Level 2 module). Modules offered by the Department of Computer Science generally start with CS.

[[nus-overseas-colleges]] NUS Overseas Colleges::
The NUS Overseas Colleges Programme, or NOC for short, is an internship programme with strong emphasis on technology
entrepreneurship. Selected candidates will spend either 6 or 12 months with a high-tech start-up and take
entrepreneurship courses at a designated partner university. NOC students will be full-time interns and
part-time students.

[[nus]] NUS::
The National University of Singapore (NUS) is the first autonomous research university in Singapore.
NUS is a comprehensive research university, offering a wide range of disciplines, including the sciences,
medicine and dentistry, design and environment, law, arts and social sciences, engineering, business,
computing and music at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Computer Science (CS) is one of the
undergraduate programmes offered by NUS.

[[preclusion]] Preclusion::
A module may also specify certain preclusions. These are modules that have similar emphases and may not be taken
together with that particular module.

[[prerequisite]] Prerequisite::
Pre-requisites indicate the base of knowledge on which the subject matter of a particular module will be built.
Before taking a module, a student should complete any pre-requisite module(s) listed for that particular module.
Where pre-requisites are specified, equivalent modules will also be accepted. If in doubt, students should consult
the module instructor or the Department academic advisor regarding the acceptable equivalent modules.

[[semester]] Semester::
An academic year in NUS consists of two regular semesters, each spanning 13 weeks excluding the recess and reading
weeks. In our application, a semester is defined as a regular semester (as opposed to special semesters).

[[student]] Student::
Our application is specifically targeted to students who study Computer Science (CS) in the School of
Computing in the National University of Singapore (NUS).

[[student-exchange-programme]] Student exchange programme::
The NUS Student Exchange Programme, or SEP for short, provides students with the opportunity to study in an overseas partner
university, usually for a semester or two, with approval of the School, to further enhance their learning experience.
Students from either partner university pay fees only at their home institution while on exchange.

[[study-plan]] Study plan::
A study plan is an academic plan detailing all modules that a student plans to take in all the semesters in their
candidature in NUS. One study plan comprises 8 semesters of modules. The user may have multiple alternative study plans.

[[SU]] S/U::
Abbreviation for Satisfactory / Unsatisfactory Options. Sometimes abbreviated as SU.
In general, students may exercise the S/U option for up to 32 MCs in the first two regular semesters;
if this is not fully utilised, the S/U option may still be exercised in subsequent semesters, for up to 12 MCs.
Modules with grades as S/U are not factored into the calculation of students' Cumulative Average Points (CAP).
Modules on which the S/U option can be exercised are described as _SU-able_.

[[tag]] Tag::
A module can be added a tag or multiple tags, which include the following:
** core module
** UE
** focus area
etc

[[UE]] UE::
UE stands for Unrestricted Elective. Unrestricted Electives enable students to pursue their academic interests and aspirations.
Students may also use Unrestricted Electives to satisfy partially or wholly the requirements of other programmes.
As long as the appropriate prerequisites are met, students can satisfy the Unrestricted Electives requirement by taking
modules from any of the Departments/Faculties at any level. The limit on the number of Level-1000 modules to be counted
towards fulfilment of graduation requirements is 60 MCs for 160-MC programmes. In CS, a student needs to
fulfill at least 32 MCs of UEs before graduation.

[[valid-module]] Valid module::
A module is said to be valid if its prerequisites have been fulfilled and none of its preclusions are being
taken at the same time as the student takes that particular module.

[[year-of-study]] Year of study::
A student's year refers to whether the student is in their first (Y1), second (Y2), third (Y3), fourth (Y4), or fifth (Y5)
year of undergraduate studies in NUS.
