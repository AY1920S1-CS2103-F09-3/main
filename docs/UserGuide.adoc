== Introduction

CS ModBuddy is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for planning their modules*.
More importantly, CS ModBuddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, CS ModBuddy can get your module planning done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `csModBuddy.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your module plan.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add SEMESTER MODULE_CODE`, `SEMESTER`
is a parameter which can be used as `add y1s1 cs1101s`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `newplan [SHORT_DESCRIPTION]` can be used as `newplan`
or as `newplan Algo and Graphics`.
* Items with ... after them can be used multiple times e.g. `TAG_NAME...` can be used as `core`, `core completed`, etc.
